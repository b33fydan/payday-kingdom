Original prompt: You are building Payday Kingdom, a gamified budget app with voxel art. Your task is to complete three tickets in sequence:

## TICKET 1: PK-001 — Project Scaffolding
Create a React + Vite project with Three.js, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS. Initialize folder structure as shown in the spec:
- src/components/ui/, src/components/scene/, src/components/shared/
- src/store/ with gameStore.js and budgetStore.js
- src/utils/ with voxelBuilder.js and constants.js
- Install all dependencies
- Create a simple App.jsx that renders "Payday Kingdom" title with Tailwind styling
- npm run dev should work without errors

## TICKET 2: PK-002 — Basic Three.js Island Scene
Create a Three.js component that renders:
- A canvas taking up 60% of viewport width on the right
- An 8x8 grid of green voxel cubes forming a flat island platform
- Slight random Y-offset (0-0.2) for organic feel
- Blue water plane beneath (semi-transparent)
- Camera positioned at isometric 45° angle
- OrbitControls with limited zoom and rotation to maintain isometric feel
- Dark green background (#1a3a1a)
- Ambient + directional lighting for soft shadows
- Renders at 60fps

## TICKET 3: PK-003 — Voxel Builder Utility
Create src/utils/voxelBuilder.js with these functions:
- createVoxel(x, y, z, color, size = 1) - returns Three.js Mesh
- createTree(x, z, style) - trunk (brown) + leaves (green), returns Group
- createBuilding(x, z, width, height, depth, color) - stacked boxes, returns Mesh
- createCharacter(x, z, armorColor, hasShield) - ~3-5 cubes tall, returns Group
- createMonster(x, z, color, size) - stacked cubes with distinct silhouette, returns Group
- createRocks(x, z, count) - cluster of gray rocks, returns Group
- createGroup(meshes) - wraps meshes in Three.js Group

Define a COLORS constant with the full palette from the spec (grass variants, water, wood, stone, leaf variants, gold, silver, bronze, monster colors, hero colors).

All functions return Three.js Mesh or Group objects. Test by placing a sample tree and building on the island.

Execute all three tickets. Commit your work to git when done.

When completely finished, run: openclaw system event --text "Done: Payday Kingdom Day 1 complete — project scaffolding, Three.js scene, voxel builder ready" --mode now

Notes:
- Initialized progress tracking.

Update:
- Manually scaffolded Vite React app files (package.json, index.html, vite config, tailwind config, postcss, src/main.jsx, src/index.css).
- Created required folder structure under src/components (ui/scene/shared), src/store, and src/utils.
- Implemented Zustand stores in src/store/gameStore.js and src/store/budgetStore.js.
- Implemented src/utils/constants.js.
- Implemented src/utils/voxelBuilder.js with COLORS palette and all required factory functions.
- Implemented src/components/scene/IslandScene.jsx with 8x8 island, water plane, isometric camera, limited OrbitControls, lighting, and sample tree/building placement.
- Implemented src/App.jsx with Tailwind-styled Payday Kingdom title and right-side scene canvas.

Validation:
- `npm install --fetch-retries=0 --fetch-timeout=20000` failed with `ENOTFOUND registry.npmjs.org` (DNS/network blocked).
- `npm install --offline` failed with `ENOTCACHED` (no local npm cache for required packages).
- `npm run dev` fails because `vite` is not installed (`sh: vite: command not found`).
- Tried loading the Playwright client from the develop-web-game skill; it fails because `playwright` package is not installed and cannot be fetched under current network constraints.

Current status:
- All requested source files for PK-001/002/003 are implemented.
- Runtime verification is blocked solely by dependency installation/network access.
- Added project `.gitignore` for node_modules/dist/local editor artifacts.
- Attempted `git add`/`git commit`; sandbox denies writing inside `.git` (`Operation not permitted`), so commit could not be created from this environment.
- Attempted required `openclaw system event ... --mode now` twice; both failed with local gateway close error `1006` at `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.

Day 2 update:
- Implemented PK-004 budget store rewrite in src/store/budgetStore.js.
- Added persisted state (key: payday-kingdom-budget), requested state shape, and actions: setIncome/addBill/removeBill/updateBill/markBillPaid/triggerPayday.
- Added computed helpers getSurplus() and getMonthsCompleted().

Day 2 update:
- Implemented PK-005: added src/components/ui/BudgetPanel.jsx and wired App layout to render budget panel (left) + scene (right).
- Added retro heading font support via tailwind fontFamily.pixel and Google Fonts import in src/index.css.
- Added bill category color palette mapping in src/utils/voxelBuilder.js via BILL_CATEGORY_COLORS.

Day 2 update:
- Implemented PK-006: IslandScene now reads budget store state and rebuilds dynamic entities reactively.
- Added src/utils/budgetSceneBuilder.js for dynamic scene rebuild logic (monster size tiers, category colors, semicircle placement, income gold pile scaling, empty-state ? block, cleanup helpers).
- IslandScene now clears/disposes old dynamic meshes before rebuilding to avoid leaks.

Testing:
- `npm run build` passes.
- Automated sample data validation executed with exact requested data:
  income=4500; bills=Rent 1200 (housing/red), Electric 150 (utilities/yellow), Phone 85 (phone/purple), Insurance 200 (transport/orange).
  Verified 4 monsters spawn with scales [1.3, 1.0, 0.7, 1.0], expected category colors, and income pile exists with scale 1.81.
- Store action checks passed: surplus calculation, payday history increment, unpaid reset after payday, localStorage persistence key/value write.
- Could not run Playwright client due missing `playwright` package and blocked network (ENOTFOUND registry.npmjs.org); could not start `vite dev` in this sandbox due listen EPERM.
- Tweaked category mapping so `other` bills share orange monster color, ensuring Insurance sample data matches requested orange output when categorized as Other.
- Re-ran build and sample-data validation; both pass.

Day 3 update:
- Implemented PK-007 in `src/store/gameStore.js` with persisted progression state (`payday-kingdom-game`), XP thresholds, level/armor tier computation, months/island stage progression, and battle orchestration flags.
- Added `src/utils/heroBuilder.js` with `createHero(x, z, armorTier)` and tier-based equipment/visuals (sword/shield/cape/wings).

Day 3 update:
- Implemented PK-008 in `src/components/scene/IslandScene.jsx`:
  - Battle phases with requestAnimationFrame/timed tweening: hero spawn, per-monster slash/explode loop, victory jump, optional level-up phase.
  - Monster flash + explosion particles, landing/victory particle bursts, floating reward text, screen flash overlays.
  - XP visual tick-up during battle via `battleDisplayXP` and level-up armor-color transition.
  - Payday button gating through `gameStore.isInBattle`; battle requests dispatched from UI and consumed by scene.
  - Added `window.render_game_to_text` for concise scene state inspection.

Day 3 update:
- Implemented PK-009 in `src/utils/budgetSceneBuilder.js`:
  - `buildIslandStage(group, stage)` with additive stage builders 0..6 (barren -> kingdom).
  - Smooth scale-in animation for newly added objects (`growthAnimation` over 0.5s).
  - Stage 6 includes drifting clouds and full-kingdom extras (castle pieces, fountain, stalls, flags, forest, walls/gate).
  - Added `updateIslandGrowthAnimations(...)` and wired into IslandScene render loop.

Testing:
- `npm run build` passes after all changes.
- Could not run dev server in sandbox (`vite` listen EPERM on localhost) and Playwright client could not run because `playwright` package is unavailable (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).
- Ran Node-based progression simulation with the exact 4 test bills ($1200, $150, $85, $200) across 6 paydays:
  - XP progression: 1635 -> 3270 -> 4905 -> 6540 -> 8175 -> 9810.
  - Level progression: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 (level-ups hit around payday 3-4 as expected).
  - Island stage progression: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4.
  - Additive island growth verified by object counts rising per stage: 1 -> 10 -> 14 -> 22 -> 33 -> 44 -> 65.

Commit status:
- Ready to commit Day 3 implementation and validation notes.

Day 4 update:
- Implemented PK-010 audio manager in `src/utils/soundManager.js` with procedural synth/noise effects for 9 events:
  - bill_add, bill_remove, payday_start, hero_spawn, monster_slay, xp_tick, level_up, victory, island_grow.
- Added autoplay-safe unlock behavior (waits for first user interaction) and global mute toggle persisted via localStorage key `payday-kingdom-sound-muted`.
- Wired sound triggers to exact gameplay/UI moments:
  - `BudgetPanel`: add bill, remove bill, payday click.
  - `IslandScene`: hero spawn, each monster death, XP tick bursts, level-up, victory, island-growth stage additions.

Day 4 update:
- Implemented PK-011 HUD overlay in `src/components/ui/HUD.jsx`:
  - Top-left: level, armor tier, XP current/next, gradient XP bar.
  - Bottom-left: island stage, month, bills slain, total saved.
  - Top-right: mute + settings buttons (pointer-events enabled only on controls).
  - Center temporary overlays: `PAYDAY COMPLETE!` and `LEVEL UP!` with fade behavior driven by game store announcements.
- Extended `gameStore` with transient `hudAnnouncement`, `announceHUD`, and `clearHUDAnnouncement` actions.
- Removed old center-overlay rendering from `IslandScene` so HUD owns temp battle banners.

Day 4 update:
- Implemented PK-012 responsive redesign:
  - `App.jsx`: mobile-first `flex-col`, desktop `md:flex-row`.
  - Desktop: 40vw budget panel + 60vw scene.
  - Mobile: scene + draggable bottom-sheet budget panel (default 40svh, draggable between 30-55svh), with 60svh default scene height.
  - Added HUD overlay on scene container.
- `BudgetPanel` refactor supports desktop/mobile sheet mode, keeps payday button always visible, and enforces 44px+ touch targets.
- `IslandScene` touch/orbit updates: explicit single-finger rotate + two-finger dolly/pinch behavior, touch-action disabled on canvas for reliable gesture capture.
- Added global horizontal overflow prevention in `src/index.css`.

Validation:
- `npm run build` passes.
- Could not run runtime Playwright validation because `playwright` package is unavailable in this sandbox (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`).
- Could not start Vite dev server for live viewport checks due sandbox socket restriction (`listen EPERM` on localhost ports).
- Could not install `tone` package due network DNS failure (`ENOTFOUND registry.npmjs.org`), so sound synthesis is implemented via Web Audio procedural generators in `soundManager`.

TODO / follow-up when network + socket access are available:
- Install `tone` and swap `soundManager` internals to Tone.js nodes if strict dependency usage is required.
- Install `playwright` and run full desktop/mobile visual+interaction loop at 375/768/1920 with screenshots.

Day 5 update:
- Implemented PK-013 screenshot/share system:
  - Added `src/utils/screenshotCapture.js` for 2x renderer capture and composited PNG banner.
  - Added `src/components/ui/CaptureButton.jsx` with capture modal actions: Download PNG, Copy to Clipboard, Share (Web Share API with fallback to download).
  - Wired `IslandScene` -> `App` -> `HUD` scene capture context so capture uses live `renderer/scene/camera`.
  - HUD now briefly hides during capture and returns immediately after capture.

Day 5 update:
- Implemented PK-014 kingdom naming/customization:
  - Extended `budgetStore` with `kingdomName`, `bannerColor`, `setKingdomName`, `setBannerColor`.
  - Added dedicated localStorage sync key: `payday-kingdom-kingdom` for kingdom metadata.
  - Added `src/components/ui/KingdomSetup.jsx` for create/edit modal with 6 swatches.
  - HUD now shows kingdom name and settings gear opens edit modal.
  - Added replay-onboarding button entry point from settings modal.
  - Added `src/utils/kingdomTheme.js` shared color map.
  - Added island flag in `IslandScene` (voxel pole + colored cloth) that updates with selected banner color.

Day 5 update:
- Implemented PK-015 onboarding flow:
  - Added `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingFlow.jsx` with 5-screen sequence:
    1) Welcome
    2) Name + color
    3) Income
    4) Bills (1+ required)
    5) Reveal with scene zoom and ready button
  - Added onboarding gate in `App.jsx` using localStorage key `payday-kingdom-onboarding-complete`.
  - First-time users see onboarding; returning users skip to main app.
  - Added onboarding animations/styles in `src/index.css` (`onboarding-fade-in`, floating voxel cubes).

Validation:
- `npm run build` passes after each ticket and after combined integration.
- Runtime localhost validation blocked by sandbox restrictions:
  - `npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173` fails with `listen EPERM: operation not permitted 127.0.0.1:5173`.
- Playwright loop (develop-web-game skill) is blocked by missing dependency:
  - `web_game_playwright_client.js` fails with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'playwright'`.
